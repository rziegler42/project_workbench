"""The document form of ``wb check``: names, statuses and candidate IDs of specs, roadmaps and
decisions, for a project that has the ``groundwork`` module.

The rules are in ``docs/specs/groundwork.md`` and in the READMEs the module writes into each area;
the decision to run them in the installer is ``docs/decisions/2026-10-21-installer-runs-document-
checks.md``. A project has the module when its committed manifest records the module ``groundwork``
of the package ``workbench``. Any other project, including one with a hand-written ``docs/specs``,
gets no report from here. A project with the module and none of the folders gets none either.

Everything read is untrusted repository content. The areas are listed and each document is read
through the writer, which follows no link and reads only a regular file. The count of documents, the
total bytes, the candidates in one roadmap, the lines of a header and the findings reported are all
bounded, and passing a bound is itself a problem that says what was not looked at. Nothing is
evaluated, and a name or heading is shown with its escapes removed.
